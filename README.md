# OWASP JAWS #

## Description ##
The purpose of the project is to have a workset with runnable java code that shows secure coding practices in a working way.
Too many times developers end up at some developer forum where someone asks a question and the solutions
(that may be working but not necessarily in a secure way) are copied and end up in production code.

The project will demonstrate how to implement existing solutions leveraging on existing material from the OWASP community.
The code in the project will have the necessary code coverage and matching unit tests to help the developer understand
the correct way to implement the code into their own projects.
Next to this all code will be deployable and as such runnable in a provided server so developers may play with the code
and get a better understanding of the solution. The provided pages in the application will provide both a protected
as well as an unprotected part so the developers can get a better understanding of how the solution mitigates some of the dangers.
